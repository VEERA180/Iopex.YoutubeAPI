Why learn Robotic Process Automation?

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is an automation technology for making smart software by applying intelligence to do high volume and repeatable tasks that are time-consuming. RPA is automating the tasks of wide variety of industries, hence reducing the time and increasing the output. Some of facts about RPA includes:

1. A 2016 report by McKinsey and Co. predicts that the robotic process automation market could be worth $6.7 trillion by 2025

2. A major global wine business, after implementing RPA, increased the order accuracy from 98% to 99.7% while costs reduced to Rs. 5.2 Crore

3. A global dairy company used RPA to automate the processing and validation of delivery claims, reduced goodwill write-offs by Rs. 464 Million

4D1Zpk9J1Q4,UiPath Tutorial 10 - Real Time Project in UiPath | Data Scraping | Send Email with Attachment,"Hi Guys!
In this video, I will provide a demo on Real Time Project in UiPath.
As this COVID-19 Global Pandemic going on, I thought of creating a project around COVID-19.
So, in the project I will use Data Scrapping to extract Web Table(which contains COVID-19 data such as number of affected people, recovered people etc) from web page. And, write the extracted data into Excel . Later on, I will send that excel over the email as attachment.
Please watch the video and do hands-on on the same.
I hope we will soon come out of this pandemic.
Stay safe and healthy, keep learning!
